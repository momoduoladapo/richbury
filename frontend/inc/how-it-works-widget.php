        <strong>Option 2:-</strong> To activate your finance access code, simply generate a referal id, and connect 5 to 30 new participants to this platform.

The least proof we want under this platform is for you to printout your business account statement showing the principal investment plus the profit you have made over time. Interest-free loan beneficiaries are to return the Principal only in 6 monthly instalments. </p>

Participants who waste or divert their trail finance from the intended purpose shall only be disqualified from the scheme but will in no way be indebted because the money is yours (a grant) anyway.

The proof we want under this condition shall be agreed at the point of collection of your second grant. If you are successful, you are then eligible for a round table conference–to negotiate the percentage of the business  you want to sell to us or external investors. Even if you are giving us 1% equity in the business, the naira value must not be more than ₦5,000,000  (five million naira ). Under this condition, you stand as m.d/ceo of the business, we stand as investors or your creditor.

      To access ₦5,000,000:00 business capital (through investors) as a first time beneficiary, contribute at least 60%  to 90% equity in cash or kind to access 60% to 90% profit sharing after executing the business. You must be able to afford a minimum cash of ₦500,000:00 cash contribution to access ₦5,000,000:00 
      </p>
      <p>
      60% of ₦5m is ₦3m. So if  you contribute a minimum cash equity of ₦500,000, you will have a balance of n2.5m which can actually be paid in kind instead of bringing cash. To pay in kind, simply connect to us with your referral id at least 5 people who need upto ₦5m capital to start or expand their business to this platform. By so doing it will be assumed you have contributed 60% equity to the business even though you actually contributed 10%. This will make you be entitled to 60% profit sharing after doing the business instead of 10%.
      </p>
      <p>
      90% of ₦5m is ₦4m. So if you contribute a minimum cash equity of ₦500,000, you will have a balance of ₦3.5m which can actually be paid in kind instead of bringing cash. To pay in kind, simply refer (with your finance access code) 7 people who need upto n5m capital to start or expand their business to this platform. By so doing it will be assumed you have contributed 90% equity to the business even though you actually contributed 10%. This will make you be entitled to 90% profit sharing after doing the business instead of 10%.
      </p>
      <p>
      To access ₦20,000,000:00 business capital (through investors) as a first time beneficiary, contribute at least 60%  to 90% equity in cash or kind to access 60% to 90% profit sharing after executing the business. You must be able to afford a minimum cash of ₦2,000,000:00 contribution to access ₦20,000,000:00 capital 
      </p>
      <p>
      60% of ₦20m is ₦12m. So if  you contribute a minimum cash equity of ₦2,000,000:00, you will have a balance of ₦10,000,000:00 which can actually be paid in kind instead of bringing cash. To pay in kind, simply connect (with your referral id) 5 people who need upto ₦20m capital to start or expand their business to this platform. By so doing it will be assumed you have contributed 60% equity to the business even though you actually contributed 10%. This will make you be entitled to 60% profit sharing after doing the business instead of 10%.

      <p>
      90% of ₦20,000:000:00 is ₦18,000,000:00. So if you contribute a minimum cash equity of ₦2,000,000:00 you will have a balance of ₦16,000,000:00 which can actually be paid in kind instead of bringing cash. To pay in kind, simply connect (with your referral id/finance access code) 7 people who need upto ₦20,000,000:00 capital to start or expand their business to this platform.
